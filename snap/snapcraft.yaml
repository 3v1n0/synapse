summary: Synapse: Matrix reference homeserver
description: |
  Matrix is an ambitious new ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and
  VoIP. The basics you need to know to get up and running are:

  Everything in Matrix happens in a room. Rooms are distributed and do not
  exist on any single server. Rooms can be located using convenience aliases
  like #matrix:matrix.org or #test:localhost:8448. Matrix user IDs look like
  @matthew:matrix.org (although in the future you will normally refer to
  yourself and others using a third party identifier (3PID): email address,
  phone number, etc rather than manipulating Matrix user IDs)

  The overall architecture is:
  client <----> homeserver <=====================> homeserver <----> client
      https://somewhere.org/_matrix        https://elsewhere.net/_matrix

  #matrix:matrix.org is the official support room for Matrix, and can be
  accessed by any client from https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html
  or via IRC bridge at irc://irc.freenode.net/matrix.

  Synapse is currently in rapid development, but as of version 0.5 we believe
  it is sufficiently stable to be run as an internet-facing service for real
  usage!
